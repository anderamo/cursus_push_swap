Hello welcome!! Write operations to get the numberssorted. For that we have 2 stacks and you can use them as you want.
The a stack will start with the numbers that you write and b stack for the moment it will be empty.
Like that!.
If you write a wrong operation the program return Error.
To check that the a stack is sort press enter(without anything more). If the numbers are already sorted or you sort with operations the program return OK else KO.
Write the operation and press enter.
GL!!!!(Good Luck:)!!!!!)
